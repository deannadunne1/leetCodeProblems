/*
Write a function to delete a node in a singly-linked list.

You will NOT be given access to the head of the list, instead youâ€™ll be given access to the node to be deleted directly.

The node you must delete will NOT be a tail node in the linked list.

 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * function ListNode(val, next) {
 *     this.val = (val===undefined ? 0 : val)
 *     this.next = (next===undefined ? null : next)
 * }

//What should I be returning?

function deleteNode(node) {
  //change node.val to node.next.val for all nodes and delete last
  if (node.val) {
    node.val = node.next.val;
    node.next = node.next.next;
    node = node.next;
    deleteNode(node);
  } else {
    //is there a way to clean up by deleting the last node or do we just leave it with undefined values?
    return;
  }
}

//Time complexity: O(n)
//Space complexity: O(1)
